# Sentimental-anlysis
The project's main goal is to classify user-provided sentences as positive or negative sentiments. It employs Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Logistic Regression for initial classification and then feeds labeled data into a sequential Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach captures local context and long-term dependencies, resulting in more accurate and nuanced sentiment analysis. By combining traditional machine learning with RNNs, the system effectively interprets subtle emotional cues, delivering proficient sentiment analysis results.
